# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

Full Stack Development > Lab: Reacting to Routing

Still Working  All Finished
Reacting to Routing
We're gonna be building pretty much the same application we made in the Reacting to APIs lab. This time we'll be using routing and multiple components instead of a bunch of conditional renders. Instead of an anchor that leads to the API resource page we're gonna be building a route and component designed to use a route parameter and display the detail's of that resource in that component directly. Fancy!

 

Getting Started
Create a new project with Create React App.
Delete the src and public directory and all of its contents.
Create a new public directory and a new index.html file inside of public.
Use the ! emmet shortcut to generate a fresh html document in the index.html file. Place <div id="root"></div> in the <body> of the html document you created. (like we did in earlier videos!)
Create a new src directory and a components directory inside of src.
Create an App.jsx and a index.js file inside of src.
Write the basic "entry point" code for the index.js file, avoid copy/paste so you can practice writing it yourself!
// inside of src/index.js
import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';
import App from './App';

ReactDOM.render(<App />, document.getElementById('root'));
Write a simple function component that returns some JSX for your App.jsx file.
// inside of /src/App.jsx
import React from 'react';

const App = () => {
    return (
        <div>
            <h1>Hello from App Component!</h1>
        </div>
    );
};

export default App;
 

You should now have a project structure that resembles the following:

node_modules/
public/
|- index.html
src/
|- components/
|- App.jsx
|- index.js
.gitignore
package-lock.json
package.json
README.md
 

Instructions
Configure React Router in your application. You may use the same structure as the walkthrough video, or (if you have a better idea) you may decide on your own structure. Just make sure that it works!

You should create three Links that look like buttons in your application. The first says "Go Home", the second says "View Films", and the last one says "View People" (or another endpoint of your choosing). Clicking these links will navigate you to the respective pages for each of these things. You can code them directly in the App.jsx or make your own <Navbar /> component instead.

Start by only configuring ONE route. Say, for /films. After navigating to localhost:3000/films, you should see your list of films that you rendered to the browser in the previous lab. The caveat? You shouldn't need any if/else if/else logic in your render methods. The data should only be loaded and displayed when you navigate to /films. You should use useEffect() and fetch() to make this request.

Once you have that route working, configure another one for /films/:filmid. With this route, you should be able to craft a Link for any film you have displayed on /films to navigate to /films/<id>, where you will list out all of the information pertaining to only that film.

Now that you have /films and /films/:filmid working, repeat tasks 3 and 4 with another two endpoints (like People) in the Studio Ghibli API.

 

Closing Remarks
At the end of this lab, you should have a Studio Ghibli "wiki" based on the data available through the API. You can extend this as much as you want - style it as much as you want - but at the end of the day you should realize that what you've just done is create your first real application using only data provided by a third-party API! This is what web developers do all the time so give yourself a pat on the back, and keep coding!
